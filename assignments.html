    <h2>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Description:</strong> In this assignment, we as a class will collectively record a dataset with elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS. Using this dataset, we determined the best location to wait in order to minimize the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator.
